                    <p>Street Views is a mutual aid <a href="street-views.pdf">newspaper</a> published by UCLA urban planning graduate students, unhoused community members, and mutual aid organizers. Our goal in creating Street Views was to build power and community by uplifting strategies of community design and planning that unhoused communities are engaging in as forms of self-governance and by creating new lines of communication among encampments and organizers across the City. Street Views is a platform for communities to plan, design, and build together through dialogue and collective visioning.</p>

                    <p>Street Views is looking for support in leading and sustaining this paper, if you are interested, please contact <a href="https://www.instagram.com/aetnastreetsolidarity/">@aetnastreetsolidarity</a> on Instagram.</p>

                    <p> An R.V. T.V. Special Report tutorial with construction instructions on how to build your very own platform on wheels. The platforms and video were made in community collaboration with residents of Aetna Street, UCLA urban planning students, unhoused activists, and Elvis Summers of The Tiny House Project. In an act of innovative resistance to the banishment of people from public by laws like LAMC 41.18 and 56.11, we offer our process as inspiration & motivation. This represents one possible approach to a DIY platform build.</p>
