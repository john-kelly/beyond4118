But it’s actually because my son had a seizure right in front of them, induced by the stress and anxiety of sweeps and all the people that come. It was something that had to happen first for them to actually stop doing that. We can keep things clean in our area and be left alone as we don’t give them a reason to come and say sweeps are necessary. We took it as an opportunity, to show that we don’t need them.

This is direct targeting, saying that you don’t belong, aren’t welcome, and shouldn’t exist. People are further removed from their communities, and dying from unnecessary deaths. I have seen lapd try to ticket someone while they were overdosing and literally dying. We ran over to help and once the police realized, they just left them there instead of helping. That’s the kind of shit that happens all the time and that we don’t forget things like that.

Like she asked, “hey, can I help my friend move things?” A cop said, “okay, you can step across the tape line during the sweep.” And as soon as she crossed the tape, they gave her a ticket. So that’s like literally a form of entrapment; as soon as she walked through the tape, they arrested her even though they said it was okay to cross the line to help them.  </div>`)[0];

It's like a direct hit for unhoused people, targeting them because it sends the message like you don't belong, like you don't exist. Like, you're not welcome here. People heard that message and left other streets that were more in public. They're like, that's not living, like I can't live like that. We saw a lot of people passing away from overdoses, who ended up being even more farther removed from their communities being cut off from having access to what they needed. The city had put like LAPD in charge of our homelessness policy, they basically could just say, this law just got passed, like you can't be here, even whether that was true or not. They had the ability to see that now they were empowered to move in and break up communities, encampments and families. This street is a lifeline for so many people, for people that are just getting out of jail or just their first day of being unhoused and you don't know where to go, somebody here is gonna have something you know, have something to share, or something to offer </div>`)[0];
