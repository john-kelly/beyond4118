This is direct targeting, saying that you don’t belong, aren’t welcome, and shouldn’t exist. People are further removed from their communities, and dying from unnecessary deaths. I have seen lapd try to ticket someone while they were overdosing and literally dying. We ran over to help and once the police realized, they just left them there instead of helping. That’s the kind of shit that happens all the time and that we don’t forget things like that.
