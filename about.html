                    <p>Beyond 41.18 emerged with the primary objective of subverting dominant narratives of homelessness by directing attention towards the pervasive inequities and criminalization of individuals who seek rest within designated 41.18 zones.</p>

                    <p>Beyond 41.18 uses counter mapping to share the stories of unhoused people and organizers living and organizing within 41.18 zones. It is a tool that seeks to center narratives of the unhoused by making visible stories that are so often ignored.</p>

                    <p>Los Angeles Municipal Code 41.18 is an anti-camping ordinance that targets the unhoused, making it illegal to sit, sleep, lie down, or have personal property within designated areas. 41.18 is a newer iteration of a law that has been present for decades.</p>

                    <p>To enforce this law, officials went around the city of LA and turned every block where homeless encampments were already present into 41.18 zones. Thus, it became legal to harass the unhoused, destroy their homes and all their personal belongings, and ticket them whenever this law was broken.</p>
