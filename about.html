                <article>
                    <p>41.18 is a newer iteration of a law that has been present for decades, one that criminalizes eating, sleeping, and sitting on sidewalks in designated 41.18 zones, or in other words, anywhere in California.</p>

                    <p>To enforce this law, officials went around the city of LA and turned every block where homeless encampments were already present into 41.18 zones. Thus, it became legal to harass the unhoused, destroy their homes and all their personal belongings, and ticket them whenever this law was broken.</p>

                    <p><b>Beyond 41.18</b> was originated to bring attention to the everyday injustices and criminalization experienced by the unhoused through the power of storytelling. Many of these stories go untold, and through the use of power mapping and storytelling, we hope to assist in the current movement working towards the abolishment of 41.18.</p>
