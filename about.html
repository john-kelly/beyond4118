                    <p><b>Beyond 41.18</b> emerged with the primary objective of directing attention towards the pervasive inequities and criminalization that individuals who seek rest within a designated 41.18 zone encounter on a daily basis. Our vision adopts the methodologies of counter mapping and storytelling to subvert narratives and policies of the state, and highlight the lived experiences of the unhoused, community members and organizers.</p>

                    <p>Los Angeles Municipal Code 41.18 is an anti-camping ordinance that targets the unhoused, making it illegal to sit, sleep, lie down, or have personal property within designated areas. 41.18 is a newer iteration of a law that has been present for decades.</p>

                    <p>To enforce this law, officials went around the city of LA and turned every block where homeless encampments were already present into 41.18 zones. Thus, it became legal to harass the unhoused, destroy their homes and all their personal belongings, and ticket them whenever this law was broken.</p>
